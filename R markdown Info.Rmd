## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring:

* HTML 
* PDF
* MS Word documents.

For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

Another way of adding hyperlink - You can embed links like this:  [Google](http://www.google.com)




When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

## Palmer Penguins - Flipper length vs Body mass

```{r Title, echo = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(palmerpenguins)
summary(penguins)
```


```{r penguins, echo = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(palmerpenguins)
ggplot(data = penguins, aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g, color = species))+geom_point()  
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

You can also embed images like this
